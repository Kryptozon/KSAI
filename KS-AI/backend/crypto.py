General Guidelines for Crypto Trading:

1. Risk Management:
   - Never risk more than 1–2% of your portfolio per trade.
   - Always use stop-loss to limit downside.

2. Take-Profit Strategy:
   - Conservative: Aim for 1.5x–2x your risk.
   - Aggressive: Aim for 3x+ but adjust stop-loss as price rises.

3. Stop-Loss Placement:
   - Place below recent swing low (for longs).
   - Place above recent swing high (for shorts).
